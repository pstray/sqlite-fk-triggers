# sqlite-fk-triggers
SQLite parses and understands the syntax for foreign key constraints, but it doesn't enforce them in any way, it does however support triggers and those can be used to enforce the foreign key constraints.

This project provides tools to generate such triggers from the the SQL used to create the tables. 

## Trigger order

Since this script generates all kinds of triggers on your tables, it is important to know in which order SQLite executes the triggers so you can put your own triggers in the right place in that order.

When a trigger-event happens, SQLite executes the triggers in alfabetical order. sqlite-fk-triggers provides the option --prefix to specify a prefix to use for all triggers generated by the program. There default value is empty, but all triggers still has the prefix 'fk', any value specified will be separated from the normal trigger name by a '_'.
