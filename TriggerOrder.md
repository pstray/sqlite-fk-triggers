# Introduction #

Since this script generates all kinds of triggers on your tables, it is important to know in which order SQLite executes the triggers so you can put your own triggers in the right place in that order.

# Details #

When a trigger-event happens, SQLite executes the triggers in alfabetical order.  **sqlite-fk-triggers** provides the option **--prefix** to specify a prefix to use for all triggers generated by the program.  There default value is empty, but all triggers still has the prefix 'fk', any value specified will be separated from the normal trigger name by a '`_`'.
